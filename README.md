<!-- Nodemon is an alternative node engine that reruns the entire application after updates and files saves.
So this is going to save a ton of time while we're developing the application code because we won't
have to manually rerun the entire app after adding new features.Instead of using Node to fire Index.js, we're going to use the node engine to fire Index.js. -->
